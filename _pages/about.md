I am a senior student majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Artificial Intelligence at Seoul National University. My academic journey has led me to a deep interest in fields such as Robust Control, Optimal Control, Nonlinear Control, and its Applications for real-world problems. I'm passionate about utilizing these control theories to solve complex problems and wish to make a meaningful impact for the future.
