Experience
======
* Mar 2023 - Present : Control and Optimization Research ([CORE](http://coregroup.snu.ac.kr/)) Lab, SNU
  * Research Intern - Advisor : Prof. Insoon Yang
  * Developed unified algorithm for Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Control and State Estimation in partially observable linear stochastic systems, where the probability distributions of disturbances and measurement noises are unknown
  * Formulated a tractable semidefinite programming problem that iteratively determines the worst-case covariance matrices of all uncertainties, significantly enhancing the scalability and efficiency of the proposed algorithm

* Jan 2024 - Feb 2024: [NEARTHLAB](https://www.nearthlab.com/)
  * Aerospace Engineering Intern, GNC Team
  * Developed DOB and LQR based position/velocity controllers in C++ & ROS2 and tested through Gazebo simulation
  * Integrated the flight controller with a companion computer for offboard flight control of quadrotors, implemented DOB+LQR and DOB+PID controllers, and conducted extensive outdoor flight experiments
