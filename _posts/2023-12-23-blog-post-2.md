## Robust Control Technique for parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, and unmodeled dynamics which preserves the relative degree of the system.

For this post, I'll briefly introduce the Robust Control technique named **Disturbance Observer(DOB)**. I first learned about DOB from 'Advance Control Techniques' class at SNU and realized that DOB has several attractive features. 

Disturbance Observer(DOB) has demonstrated significant success in various industrial applications, owing to its robust capabilities to handle disturbances and model uncertainties.
DOB serves as an add-on type inner-loop controller that makes the plant behaves just like a nominal plant, relieving the outer controller from the difficulties of addressing model uncertainties and disturbances. Imagine you already have your own controller for the specific system you've designed using the **Nominal model**. 

> But, how confident are you with the model you have? 

Can you assert that your model fully represents your true system? This problem is particulary important for Safety Critial Systems(e.g., UAV, Robots, Autonomous Vehicles). In real world application, your true model may differ from your nominal model, and various factors contribute to this difference:

1. Parametric Uncertainties: Your model parameters, such as mass or length, might differ from your true system.
2. External Disturbances: For instance, your UAV might be affected by the wind while flying
3. Unmodeled Dynamics: Usually your model is designed using simplified dynamics(often linearized). The system's dynamics, such as those inside the motors or the elasticity of the beam, are often ignored, which can change the system's degree.

## Basic Concept of DOB
