## Unveiling the Success of Disturbance Observer in Real-world applications

For this post, I'll breifly introduce the Robust Control technique named **Disturbance Observer(DOB)**. I first learned about DOB from 'Advance Control Techniques' class at SNU and discovered that DOB has several attractive features. 

Disturbance Observer(DOB) has demonstrated significant success in various industrial applications, owing to its robust capabilities to handle disturbances and model uncertainties.
DOB serves as an add-on type inner-loop controller that makes the plant behaves like a nominal plant, relieving the outer controller from the difficulties of addressing model uncertainties and disturbances.
