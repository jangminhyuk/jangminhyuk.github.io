# DOB + MPC simulation

In this post, I'll present simulation results for DOB + MPC(Model Predictive Control), using the quadrotor dynamics. Recently, quadrotors are often used to deliver payloads such as food or medical devices to the rural areas. Various methods such as adaptive control are suggested to handle these uncertainties with disturbances. In this post, we explore the use of DOB as an add-on robust controller in conjunction with MPC.

## Why DOB+MPC?

Typically, MPC employs a linear state-space model and optimizes a quadratic cost function for a finite horizon in the future. The quality of the model significantly influences the prediction of the system behavior, especially for real-world MPC performance. To address this challenge, the concept of DOB comes into play, ensuring that the true dynamic model behaves similar to the nominal model. If DOB successfully makes the true system behavior just as the nominal model, it gives confidence in utilizing model-based algorithms like MPC.

For simplicity, I assumed that the mass-spring-damper payload dynamics only affect the z-dynamics of the quadrotor. Let the state variables of quadrotor dynamics as follows:
- $\ddot{x} &= (\cos\phi \sin\theta \cos \psi + \sin \phi \sin\psi)\frac{U_1}{m}$
- $\ddot{y} &= (\cos\phi \sin\theta \sin \psi - \sin \phi \cos\psi)\frac{U_1}{m}$
- $\ddot{z} &= -g+(\cos\phi \cos\theta)\frac{U_1}{m} + \frac{c}{m}(\dot{z_c}-\dot{z})-\frac{k_c}{m}(z-z_c)$
- $\ddot{z_c} &= -g - \frac{c}{m_c}(\dot{z_c}-\dot{z})+\frac{k_c}{m_c}(z-z_c)$
- $\ddot{\phi} &= \dot{\theta}\dot{\psi}(\frac{I_y-I_z}{I_x})+\frac{L}{I_x}U_2$
- $\ddot{\theta} &= \dot{\phi}\dot{\psi}(\frac{I_z-I_x}{I_y})+\frac{L}{I_y}U_3$
- $\ddot{\psi} &= \dot{\phi}\dot{\theta}(\frac{I_x-I_y}{I_z}) + \frac{1}{I_z}U_4$
