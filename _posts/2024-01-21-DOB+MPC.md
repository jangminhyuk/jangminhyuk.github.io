## DOB + MPC simulation of quadrotor delivery application

In this post, I'll present simulation results for DOB + MPC(Model Predictive Control), using the quadrotor dynamics. Recently, quadrotors are often used to deliver payloads such as food or medical devices to the rural areas. Various methods such as adaptive control are suggested to handle these uncertainties with disturbances. In this post, we explore the use of DOB as an add-on robust controller in conjunction with MPC.

## Why DOB+MPC?

Typically, MPC employs a linear state-space model and optimizes a quadratic cost function for a finite horizon in the future. The quality of the model significantly influences the prediction of the system behavior, especially for real-world MPC performance. To address this challenge, the concept of DOB comes into play, ensuring that the true dynamic model behaves similar to the nominal model. If DOB successfully makes the true system behavior just as the nominal model, it gives confidence in utilizing model-based algorithms like MPC.

## Quadrotor Dynamics with mass-spring-damper payload attached

For simplicity, I assumed that the mass-spring-damper payload dynamics only affect the z-dynamics of the quadrotor. Let the state variables of quadrotor dynamics as follows:
- $(x,y,z)$ : Position of the center of the gravity of the quadrotor
- $(z_c)$ : Position of the cargo in z coordinate
- $(\phi, \theta, \psi)$ : Roll, Pitch, Yaw angle of the quadrotor
- $(\dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{z})$ : Velocity of the quadrotor for each coordinate in earth-frame
- $(\dot{z}_c)$ : Velocity of the cargo in z coordinate
- $(\dot{\phi}, \dot{\theta}, \dot{\psi})$ : Angular velocity for each coordinate in body-frame

### Dynamical model of the quadrotor

The dynamical model of the quadrotor can be written as following equations:
- $\ddot{x} = (\cos\phi \sin\theta \cos \psi + \sin \phi \sin\psi)\frac{U_1}{m}$
- $\ddot{y} = (\cos\phi \sin\theta \sin \psi - \sin \phi \cos\psi)\frac{U_1}{m}$
- $\ddot{z} = -g+(\cos\phi \cos\theta)\frac{U_1}{m} + \frac{c}{m}(\dot{z_c}-\dot{z})-\frac{k_c}{m}(z-z_c)$
- $\ddot{z_c} = -g - \frac{c}{m_c}(\dot{z_c}-\dot{z})+\frac{k_c}{m_c}(z-z_c)$
- $\ddot{\phi} = \dot{\theta}\dot{\psi}(\frac{I_y-I_z}{I_x})+\frac{L}{I_x}U_2$
- $\ddot{\theta} = \dot{\phi}\dot{\psi}(\frac{I_z-I_x}{I_y})+\frac{L}{I_y}U_3$
- $\ddot{\psi} = \dot{\phi}\dot{\theta}(\frac{I_x-I_y}{I_z}) + \frac{1}{I_z}U_4$

where $m$ and $m_c$ is the mass of the quadrotor and the payload each. Also, $k_c$ denotes the spring constant of the payload, and $c$ denotes the damping constant of the equivalent mass-spring-damper system. $I_x, I_y, I_z$ represents the moments of inertia for each coordinate. Note that the mass-spring-damper system of payload was added to the z-dynamics. Here, air drag force and reaction forces from the propeller blades were ignored and treated as disturbances. For the simulation, we utilized the above dynamics as the true dynamics with the unknown parameters. 

### Simplified Dynamical model of the quadrotor

Since the dynamics are complex and coupled between each other, the well-known decoupling techniques were used to simplify the system. With the small angle approximation, we get the linearized dynamics of the quadrotor as follows:
- $\ddot{x}=g\theta$
- $\ddot{y}= -g\phi$
- $\ddot{z} = -g+ \frac{U_1}{m_n}$
- $\ddot{\phi} =\frac{L_n}{I_{x,n}}U_2$
- $\ddot{\theta} = \frac{L_n}{I_{y,n}}U_3$
- $\ddot{\psi} =  \frac{1}{I_{z,n}}U_4$

where index $n$ denotes the nominal parameter we used. Note that our nominal dynamics do not include any information of the payload.
Many existing model-based control algorithms, such as Optimal Control, rely on simplified model for controller design. However, the performance of these controllers degrades when the true dynamics of the system deviate from the nominal model. Additionally, it is important to determine whether the simplified dynamics adequately represent the true dynamics. For controller designer, it is important to ensure the controller designed from simplified dynamics will also work well in true system, especially in safety-critical systems, which is typically hard to verify.

The power of DOB becomes apparent in addressing this challenge by ensuring that the true dynamics closely follow the simplified decoupled dynamics. This increases confidence of the control engineer when designing their own controller. In this context, we implement DOB for each state variable $(x,y,z)$ and $(\phi, \theta, \psi)$ to behave as the simplified decoupled model. Also, additional strength of the DOB has emerged while implementation as it also provides the true state variable within the High-gain observer structure. We leveraged this information to design a stabilizing controller using MPC.

## Control Objective

1. Starting from $x=y=z=0$, arrive $x=1, y=1, z=4$ while stabilizing the system
2. State of the quadrotor needs to satisfy the following constraints
  - $-0.45\pi \leq \phi, \theta \leq 0.45\pi$
  - $-0.5\pi \leq \psi \leq 0.5\pi$
  - $-10 \leq x,y \leq 10$
  - $0 \leq z \leq 10$
3. The mass-spring-damper payload was attached from the beginning and released at $t=50s$ (payload delivered!). Quadrotor should maintain stability despite the rapid change of the dynamics.

### DOB Design

Before designing the DOB Q-filter, let's analyze the relative degree of the system to determine whether the DOB can effectively handle the unmodeled dynamics from the payload. From the simplified dynamics, we observe that the dynamics of $z, \phi, \theta, \psi$ are double integrators, while the dynamics of $x, y$ are quadruple integrators. In other words, the nominal dynamics of $z, \phi, \theta, \psi$ have a relative degree of 2, while the nominal dynamics of $x$ and $y$ have a relative degree of 4. The former group works as "fast" states, and $x, y$ works as "slow" states. 

To design the controller, we decomposed the dynamics into two modules, position($x,y,z$) and attitude($\phi,\theta,\psi$) dynamics. This approach is commonly used in controller design, where the attitude controller stabilizes the angles to follow the desired angles. Also, the position controller provides the attitude controller with the reference angle to reach the desired position at a higher level. Additionally, for the $x$ and $y$ dynamics, $\theta$ and $\psi$ are considered as inputs, allowing all 6 states in simplified dynamics to be regarded as relative degree 2. The nominal dynamics for the attitude controller can be expressed in linear state space as:

$ \begin{bmatrix}\dot{\phi} \\\dot{\theta} \\  \dot{\psi} \\  \ddot{\phi}\\  \ddot{\theta} \\  \ddot{\psi} \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}  {\phi} \\
{\theta} \\  {\psi} \\ \dot{\phi}\\ \dot{\theta} \\  \dot{\psi} \end{bmatrix}  +  \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\  0 & 0 & 0 \\  0 & 0 & 0 \\  \frac{L_n}{I_{x,n}} & 0 & 0 \\  0 & \frac{L_n}{I_{y,n}} & 0 \\  0 & 0 & \frac{1}{I_{z,n}}  \end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix}  U_2 \\  U_3 \\  U_4  \end{bmatrix}$

similarly, the nominal position dynamics can be written as

$\begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \\ \dot{z} \\ \ddot{x}\\ \ddot{y} \\
        \ddot{z}
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        {x} \\
        {y} \\
        {z} \\
        \dot{x}\\
        \dot{y} \\
        \dot{z}
    \end{bmatrix}
    +
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 \\
        g & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & -g & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & \frac{1}{m_n}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        U_2 \\
        U_3 \\
        U_4
    \end{bmatrix}$
